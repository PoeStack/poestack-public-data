The csv file headers are

Key, Tag, Properties, Type, StockRangeStartInclusive, Value

The StockRangeStartInclusive is the filter that is applied to the listing for stock. So if it's 0 all listings were considered for that value, if it's 30 only listings with at least 30 stock were considered. Values are always priced in chaos.
